This app was initialized with [create-near-app]


Step 0: Installation
-------------------------------------

1. Clone this repo

2. Run `yarn` to instal dependencies

3. Run `yarn test` to run tests

4. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

5. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account job-board.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

5. Run `export CONTRACT_NAME=job-board.YOUR-NAME.testnet`

6. Run `export ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR-NAME.testnet`


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `job-board.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `job-board.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account job-board.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet


Step 2: set contract name in code
---------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'job-board.YOUR-NAME.testnet'


Step 3: deploy!
---------------

One command:

    yarn deploy

As you can see in `package.json`, this does two things:

1. builds & deploys smart contract to NEAR TestNet
2. builds & deploys frontend code to GitHub using [gh-pages]. This will only work if the project already has a repository set up on GitHub. Feel free to modify the `deploy` script in `package.json` to deploy elsewhere.


Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.
